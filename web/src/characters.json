Office Security enrolled in this competition to finally meet Pwetty Princess in person, but she never showed up. Corporate Lawyer, a 35-year-old incompetent businessman, asserts that he merely wished to try hunting for the first time. He appears to be dumb and incompetent, although this is perhaps a disguise.
