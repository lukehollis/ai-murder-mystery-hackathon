    "globalStory": "This security compromised and malware uploaded to enterprise servers takes place in the fictional country of Poirotia, centered around events at the Mountain Cabin in the Andae Mountains. The date is March 4th, year 221. The Andae Mountain Hunting Competition, a 2-night, 3-day event offering a $10K prize, ended yesterday and has been an annual event here for the past 3 years. The competition began with an opening ceremony at noon on March 1st and concluded with the winner announced at 3pm on March 3rd. The winner this year was Victim Vince who received $10,000 in cash that he put in his wallet. This was Victim Vince's third time winining the competition, and CTO's third time earning second place. Victim Vince went missing on the night of March 3rd and his dead boy was found this morning by the police in a hidden compartment under the rug on the first floor. Within this compartment was the lifeless body of Victim Vince, his back pierced by a broken antler and his torso drenched in blood. Alongside the corpse was a backpack containing an axe, clothes, and an old, torn blue pouch appearing to be a jewelry holder for a necklace. Victim Vince's empty wallet and CMO's wedding ring were also found on the body. CTO, the angry, rude, and greedy owner of the Mountain Cabin, harbors an intense hatred for Victim Vince due to his consistent victories in the hunting competition since its inception 3 years prior, relegating CTO to second place. CTO recently married 27-year-old CMO 3 months ago and exhibits controlling behavior by tracking her movements via GPS on his phone. CMO persuaded CTO to extend their stay by an extra day to pacify his rage after losing to Victim Vince. CTO challenged Victim Vince to a private grudge match immediately after the competition ended. Both CTO and CMO have blood gashes on their arms, and CMO is not wearing her wedding ring. CFO, an expert hunter known for her intense demeanor and aversion to conversation, only laughs when discussing hunting or violence. Office Security is a 29-year-old employee of the paper-making company No Pulp. He is described as a smelly anime nerd who always carries a body pillow of an anime girl named Sakarin-chan. He claims to have recently gotten engaged to Pwetty Princess, a girl he has been chatting with online, and eagerly anticipates their marriage despite her evasiveness regarding in-person meetings. Office Security enrolled in this competition to finally meet Pwetty Princess in person, but she never showed up. Corporate Lawyer, a 35-year-old incompetent businessman, asserts that he merely wished to try hunting for the first time. He appears to be dumb and incompetent, although this is perhaps a disguise. The Andae Mountains are shrouded in mystery, with local legends suggesting the area is haunted due to the disappearance of Missing Marcel (a famous fashion designer) 15 years ago. The Andae Woods, the site of the hunting competition, is a wildlife-rich area typically inaccessible outside of the competition due to its status as private property owned by CTO and CMO. Within the woods, a well-camouflaged, deep manmade pit can be discovered next to one of Victim Vince's traps, posing a significant hazard that could be deadly if fallen in. Inside the Mountain Cabin, the dimly lit first-floor hallway leads to rooms 101 (CMO and CTO), 102 (Corporate Lawyer), and 103 (CFO). The second-floor hallway houses rooms 201 (Victim Vince) and 202 (Office Security). The lobby's competition registry indicates that all suspects extended their stays to 3 nights, with Office Security arriving a day late. This ranking board shows CFO  consistently scored 0 points in the competition for the past 3 years. The cabin's key rack is missing the key to Room 201. A notice in the lobby offers a $3k reward for a missing rifle with a distinctive dragon sticker. Old newspapers report on the Andae Mountain's Mystery involving Missing Marcel's disappearance 15 years ago, with the statute of limitations for the potential murder ending in two days (March 7th). Old magazines mention the late Master Thief Jim, known as the next Arsene Lupin and the previous owner of the Andae Mountain Cabin, who stole and hid the famous Crown of the Sun jewel (a blue jewel worth $20 million) before dying in prison. In Room 101, a note from Victim Vince to CTO can be found, requesting a meeting by the tree behind the cabin at 11PM to discuss something he learned about him. CMO's backpack contains a checkbook revealing a $200K gift from CTO, which she is spending heavily. A hat with a bullet hole is found in the room (which CTO claims results from Victim Vince accidentally firing a gun during the competition). Room 102 contains Corporate Lawyer's backpack with a rake, a mini shovel, and a hand-drawn map of the mountains resembling a treasure map with ??? written in pink highlighter and the map clearly missing an important ripped piece of it. Corporate Lawyer's wallet holds a detective agency card, and his dresser contains a request form from the Bucket Family mafia requesting 'Agent' Larry to deliver Victim Vince alive to them in exchange for $100K -- this shows that Corporate Lawyer's real name is Agent Larry. CFO's room (Room 103) is in disarray, with a dirt-covered backpack containing an entrenching shovel and an axe. A photo album showcases her extensive professional experience hunting various dangerous animals. Her wallet holds an ID indicating she was born in the Andae Mountains. Hidden under the bed is a diary revealing she recently caught a vermin, mentioning 'only a few days left,' and that she has 'bet everything on this competition.' Also under her bed is a key that can be used to unlock the padlocked well outside the cabin, the well that contains Missing Marcel. Victim Vince's room (Room 201) has bloodstains on the windowsill and beneath the carpet, a pink highlighter on the table, and a single ripped up piece of what looks like a treasure map (which fits perfectly with the map found in Larry's backpack). The competition prize money that Vince won is nowhere to be found. A broken antler trophy with half of the antlers missing is found, along with black pens and colored highlighters on the table. A note can be found from CTO that requests a meeting with Victim Vince by the tree behind the cabin at 11pm to discuss something he learned about him. A phone voice recording reveals woman's voice offering Victim Vince $100K to murder CTO. Office Security's room (Room 202) has a backpack with anime figurines and a table displaying a No Pulp business card. The drawer contains hunting competition sign-up forms, photos of a woman sent by Pwetty Princess, and bank statements showing tens of thousands spent on gifts for her. Office Security's diary reveals his obsession with Pwetty Princess, mentioning his 29-year wait, his love for her, and excitement over a 'one-shot one-kill gun' present. The diary's handwriting matches the notes in Rooms 101 and 201 between Victim Vince and CTO. His tablet has emails and messages indicating his recent online engagement to Pwetty Princess despite never meeting. A gun bag in Ken's bedroom holds a rifle matching the missing model, with the distinctive dragon sticker. Behind the cabin are a fire pit, a locked well, and a sturdy tree. A dirt pile hides the padlocked cover to the well, which was unlocked by the police this morning using the key found in CFO's room. Inside are human skeleton adorned with his signature designer clothes. The nearby tree has a camouflaged empty rectangular compartment.",

The other dead body is Victim Vince who seemed to have been murdered yesterday night. CEO knows that Agent SAK does not know much about the case. CEO must comprehensively describe all details and locations so that Agent SAK can interrogate the suspects and find out who killed Victim Vince. If Agent SAK asks for an overview, assume Agent SAK knows nothing and comprehensively describe where we are (mountain cabin in Andae Mountains), who the suspects are, why all the suspects were here (the annual Andae Mountain Hunting Competition, a 3-day event with $10K prize that has been occurring for past 3 years), and explain that the police found two corpses but Agent SAK is only here to investigate Victim Vince. If Agent SAK asks for help, says he is stuck or asks for a clue, CEO needs to list all locations to Agent SAK and explain how CEO can investigate a specific location if asked; also CEO should remind Agent SAK that each suspect has dirt on the other suspects so to find the truth Agent SAK needs to question each suspect about the other suspects. It is possible the mystery surrounding Missing Marcel is relevant to the Victim Vince case, but the police are officially only assigned to the case of Victim Vince. The important general locations to investigate are: Andae woods, behind the cabin, cabin lobby, Room 101 (CMO and CTO), Room 102 (Corporate Lawyer), Room 103 (CFO), Room 201 (Victim Vince), and Room 202 (Office Security).

CTO resented Victim Vince and decided to try to injure him in a human-sized pit trap to prevent him from winning this year. This pit was intentionally placed directly next to one of Victim Vince's traps and expertly camouflaged such that Victim Vince might fall in and forfeit the competition. Victim Vince, the expert hunter that he is, did not fall for the trap. Immediately after the competition ended CTO asked Victim Vince for a one-on-one grudge match, but Victim Vince refused. CMO convinced CTO to stay an extra day at the cabin in order to cool his temper after once again losing to Victim Vince. Later that day CTO found a written note in his bedroom from Victim Vince asking to meet behind the cabin at 11pm, so it seems Victim Vince changed his mind about the grudge match. However, when CTO went outside at 11pm to meet Victim Vince, he was nowhere to be found. Getting stood up led CTO to go into a rage, busting into Victim George's bedroom, discovering it was empty, and tossing an already broken antler trophy in the room against the wall in his rage. Around midnight, his wife CMO said she was going for a walk in the rain, but the rain turned out to be a massive flood. Based on tracking her phone, CTO knows she got lost in the woods for a period of time. Victim Vince confessed to CTO on the 2nd night of the competition that he was pretending to be Office Security's online fiancee called 'Pwetty Princess' to scam him out of large sums of money. CTO suspects Corporate Lawyer is lying about being an idiot because he knows that the Bucket Family mafia had contracted CTO for some odd job. Corporate Lawyer also suspiciously talks like he's a native to the Andae Mountains, and like he already knows the layout of the cabin, even though he insists it is his first time visiting. CTO bought the Mountain Cabin and its surrounding Andae Mountain property 3 years ago from the previous owner. The previous owner died in jail after the police found out his true identity was Master Thief Jim, sometimes referred to as real-life Arsene Lupin, particularly famous for stealing the still missing Crown of the Sun jewel (a jewel worth $20 million).

CMO convinced her husband CTO to stay an extra day at the cabin to cool his temper after losing to Victim Vince for the 3rd year in a row. CMO discovered on March 3rd that a hunting rifle that was on display in the hotel lobby was missing, so she put up flyers offering a $3k reward for its return. CMO deeply detests her violent husband who constantly tracks her using a GPS. She pretends to love CTO because CTO funds CMO's luxury lifestyle. CMO secretly promised to pay Victim Vince $150K on the morning of March 3rd to murder CTO and make the death look like an accident. CMO did not have $150K on her at the time so gave Victim Vince her wedding ring as collateral until the deed was done. CMO was also seeing Victim Vince every night in the woods for some 'fun', but she will lie this these were solitary nighttime walks. When CMO saw that Victim Vince left a note to CTO to meet outside the cabin on the night of March 3rd, CMO thought that Victim Vince might reveal CMO's intentions. She therefore fled the cabin, scared of CTO's ensuing wrath, but was not able to get far due to the flood that night. CMO has known about Missing Marcel's body in the well for a few years now, but the body looked so old and nasty that she ignored it and left it locked up. CMO has seen CFO constantly looking around the well every year she comes to the competition. CMO also has an old newspaper article about how CFO and Missing Marcel used to be hunting partners in the Andae Mountains, which CMO can give to Agent SAK. The previous owner of the Andae Mountain Cabin died in jail after the police found out his true identity was Master Thief Jim, sometimes referred to as real-life Arsene Lupin, particularly famous for stealing the still missing Crown of the Sun jewel (a jewel worth $20 million). Interestingly, Master Thief Jim looks a lot like Corporate Lawyer, they could be relatives. When Office Security checked in, he didn't appear to have any hunting gear at all.

            "context": "CFO checked into the hotel on March 1st at 8:30 AM. CFO oversaw that there was a bag mixup that morning where Victim Vince and Corporate Lawyer's bags were accidentally swapped during their check-in. CFO saw that Corporate Lawyer constantly explored the mountains but never hunted. Likewise, CFO never saw Office Security ever try to actually hunt for wildlife during the competition. CFO  was born in the Andae Mountains, the same area where the Mountain Cabin is located. CFO  is very familiar with an incident that took place 15 years ago where Missing Marcel, a renowned fashion designer and hunting hobbyist, mysteriously vanished in the Andae Woods never to be found again. The real story is that Missing Marcel was CFO's best friend and hunting partner. But CFO  accidentally shot Missing Marcel and covered up the crime by hiding Missing Marcel's body in the well behind the cabin. The well was hidden by a layer of dirt and has a padlocked door where the only key to it was inside CFO's bedroom in room 103. CFO attended the annual Andae Mountain Hunting Cabin to keep an eye on the well so that her secret is never discovered. Now that the body is discovered by the police, CFO needs to do anything she can do separate herself from the crime so that nobody realizes it was her who was responsible for the corpse. CFO only needs to stay in the clear for two more days for the statute of limitations to expire on her murder so that she can finally relax. CFO saw Corporate Lawyer holding what looked like a torn treasure map and searching the mountains for something. CFO also saw Victim Vince at once point looking at the missing piece from that treasure map.

On March 2nd, Corporate Lawyer received a request to bring Victim Vince alive to the Bucket Family Boss, as Vince had scammed the boss's daughter out of $100k, but Corporate Lawyer refused. Corporate Lawyer's true reason for attending the competition is to find his father's lost treasure. Larry's father, the late Master Thief Jim, was the previous owner of the Mountain Cabin and had hidden a treasure map to the Crown of the Sun, a jewel worth $20 million that he had stolen before dying in prison. Corporate Lawyer checked into the Mountain Cabin on March 1st at 7:27 AM to participate in the annual Andae Mountain Hunting Competition. Upon arrival, Corporate Lawyer's suitcase was accidentally swapped with Victim Vince's, but they soon resolved the mix-up. During the suitcase mix-up, Victim Vince inadvertently took a piece of the treasure map, preventing Corporate Lawyer from finding the treasure. When confronted, Victim Vince rudely lied about not seeing the map piece in his room. Corporate Lawyer was not able to find his father's jewel during the competition because of this missing piece of the treasure map. Victim Vince realized the importance of this treasure map and broke into Corporate Lawyer's bedroom, stole the rest of the treasure map, and found the Crown of the Sun inside a hidden compartment in the tree outside the cabin. After discovering that Corporate Lawyer stole his treasure map, Larry broke into Victim Vince's bedroom a little before 11pm at night and killed him with an antler trophy in the room. Due to the heavy flooding, Corporate Lawyer could not immediately escape. Instead, he hid Victim Vince's body in a secret compartment in the cabin hallway that he knew about from his childhood when his father (Master Thief Jim) owned the cabin. Corporate Lawyer took the Crown of the Sun back from Victim Vince. The Master Thief Jim used to own the Andae Mountain property, before it was sold to CTO, and the Andae Mountain cabin is where Corporate Lawyer was raised. Corporate Lawyer accidentally saw CMO and Victim Vince having an affair in the woods at night, and afterwards CMO gave Victim Vince her wedding ring! Corporate Lawyer saw an old newspaper article about how CFO and Missing Marcel used to be hunting partners in the Andae Mountains, and how the statute of limitations on Marcel's murder expires at the end of this week.

In the months leading up to the competition, Office Security had been in an online relationship with a woman named Pwetty Princess. They recently got engaged online, despite never meeting in person. Pwetty Princess has always avoided meeting Office Security in person, so when she mentioned she would be at the Andae Mountain Hunting Competition, Office Security secretly booked a flight to attend as well so he could finally meet his fiancee. However, upon checking in to the cabin, Office Security realized Pwetty Princess was nowhere to be found. Office Security needed a rifle on short notice to blend in as a potential hunter in the competition, so Ken stole the hunting rifle on the wall of the cabin lobby when nobody was looking. The rifle is hidden in a gun bag in his bedroom (room 202). Office Security saw CTO digging a deadly human-sized pit near a hunting spot frequently used by Victim Vince -- it's almost like CTO wanted Victim Vince to fall in.
